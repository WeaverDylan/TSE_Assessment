## Scenario 1: Customer Reports Python Script Error

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out, and I’m sorry for the disruption. I understand how urgent this is, and I’m glad you shared the full error message.

Based on the message you provided, the script is encountering a record where the date field is missing or blank. When the script tries to format that value as a date, it fails because there’s no date present to work with. Even if the script worked last week, this can happen if new or updated data was introduced with an empty date value.

We should be able to easily fix this for you. The script just needs to safely handle records where the date isn’t present, rather than assuming every record has one. Once that check is in place, everything should work correctly even if some records have missing dates.

So we know best how to handle missing dates, is it acceptable for records with missing dates to have a blank date field or would you prefer a placeholder value?

I know this is time-sensitive, so I’m happy to stay on this with you until it’s resolved.

Best regards,

## Scenario 2: Customer Asks "How Do I...?" Question

Subject: Re: Question about automating monthly reports

Hi James,

Thanks for reaching out. This is a great question, and I believe automating this process with Python can save you a lot of time.

Yes, what you’re describing is possible, and Python is commonly used for automation like this. Python can handle running the report, performing calculations, formatting the output (such as Excel), and emailing it on a schedule.

You don’t need to be a programmer to get this working and I'd be happy to help you through the process of setting this up. Before recommending the best approach, I’d like to understand a bit more about your current process so I can best recommend how to automate this. Is there a time you would be available to chat this week?

Looking forward to helping you streamline this.

Best regards,

Dylan Weaver
